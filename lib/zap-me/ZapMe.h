  /*
   * DogTronic uses a sync preamble of short pulses followed by a relatively
   * slow series of constant length pulses. The gaps inbetween the pulses
   * encode bits (short gap is 0, long gap is 1) and each command has 16 bits.
   *
   * For a command c[15:0], we have:
   *
   * c[15:10] - 6-bit ID (presumably)
   * c[9:6]   - 4-bit shock strength (LSB first)
   * c[5:4]   - 2-bit constant 0b10, unknown purpose
   * c[3:0]   - 4-bit checksum (see below)
   *
   * The checksum c[3:0] is particularly weird of construction:
   *
   * This is a 4-bit value, but the bits are reordered, the proper number
   * is reconstructed as c[2] c[3] c[0] c[1], so this is MSB but the bits
   * have been pairwise swapped. Apart from that, it is a simple sum that
   * does not cover the ID, but only the strength. Since the constant at
   * c[5:4] never changes, we can't tell if it is part of the sum or not.
   * The sum starts at an offset of 0b0100 and then the strength is added.
   * However, if an overflow beyond 4-bit occurs, the sum is not simply
   * truncated (mod 16), but the overflow bit is fed back into the register
   * from the LSB side, so the checksum is:
   *
   *   (0b0100 + strength) mod 16 + (0b0100 + strength) >> 4.
   *
   * Internally, this is probably a 4-bit full adder with the carry-out
   * hard-wired back to the carry-in.
   *
   * IMPORTANT: So far, with this implementation, the collar only accepts
   *            4 different IDs as valid, these are: 14, 23, 44 and 53.
   *            We don't know, why this is the case, it could be tied to
   *            the checksum somehow but without more samples, it is hard
   *            to tell.
